# Mall_Customer_Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
## Project Overview
This project implements a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The goal is to segment customers into distinct groups, allowing for targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.

## Features
- Customer Segmentation: Uses purchase history data to group customers into clusters with similar buying behaviors.
- K-Means Clustering: An unsupervised machine learning algorithm is applied to identify patterns in customer data.
- Data Visualization: Visualizes the clusters to provide insights into different customer segments.

## Technologies Used
Python
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For implementing the K-means clustering algorithm.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

## Usage
- Load the dataset: Ensure that the customer purchase history data is available in the specified path.
- Run the K-means clustering algorithm: Execute the script to segment customers into clusters based on their purchase history.
- Analyze the clusters: Visualize and interpret the resulting customer segments to inform business strategies.
